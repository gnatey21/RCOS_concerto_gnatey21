This semester, a significant amount of time has been spent debugging and analyzing the contents of the existing Concerto Repository. In terms of software, we have cloned the existing concerto repository, and have made several attempts to build the concerto server-side software. So far, there appear to be broken dependencies in the apt package manager version of the software, and the existing docker file does not build. We have spent some time working through the existing build file, and finding points of failure for the build.

On the hardware side, we have retrieved an existing Concerto player box from the Amos Eaton display, and have attempted to power on the machine to analyze the player software. So far, we have found that the box is currently inoperable. After some experimenting, we were able to boot the computer to the BIOS menu, but have been unable to access the existing OS. One of the two RAM sticks on board the device has died, and the remaining stick does not have enough space to boot into the OS. We expect to need 1 or 2GBs of ram for this to work. We are exploring avenues to get a spare stick, with the help of Dr. Kuzmin.
