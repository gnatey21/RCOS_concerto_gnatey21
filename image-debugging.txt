This text file is intended to document progress on attempting to get the concerto docker image runnin.
At the time of first writing (7/16/24), we have managed to get the database and concerto images talking to each other, though we are still encountering errors related to ruby gems.
Our current fixes are documented below:

7/16/24
- Download an sql image from dockerhub. The concerto image is included with the repository, but it seems we need to provide a databse image as well
-- https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql
- use compose up to combine both mysql and concerto images
- in the event of an error, in the docker-compose file, disable auto-restart for both images. It makes it easier to follow errors, and the sql image in particular has issues with restarting from a crash
- in the event of an error, clear volumes before rerunning images. There appears to be an issue with sql trying to restore its previous state from a crash that leads to another crash
- in the Gemfile, include the date gem, version 3.3.4

All of the above fixes have been committed to the repository (except for the sql image, the end user will have to do that)
